  <p style="font-family:impact;"> This is a web-based interactive story, so YOU get to decide what happens!</p>

<p style="font-family:courier;"> You've called your parents and they are happy for you and approve of your choice to live in Boston. "San Francisco has too many earth quakes" your mom said. Next, you packed quickly and booked the next flight into Boston Logan International. You live with some old friends of your parents until you find an apartment. You are looking at two possible areas: The North End or Fenway-Kenmore.

<p style="font-family:courier;"> Which part of Boston do you want to live in? </p>
