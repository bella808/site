<h1 style="font-family:impact;">THE END</h1>

<p style="font-family:courier;"> It has been a long week. You go to the gas station to fill up your rental car, when you get out someone sees that you are NOT wearing the local baseball team's merch (it's opening day) and you get yeeted across the parking lot. You break both of your hands on impact, so you can no longer type or write, therefore no longer able to be a journalist.s
