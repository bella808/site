  <p style="font-family:impact;"> This is a web-based interactive story, so YOU get to decide what happens!</p>

<p style="font-family:courier;"> You have always lived in Chicago, Illinois. Today the weather is particularly depressing with an unbreaking gray sky with a light rain that's only predicted to get worse. You currently are living alone in your 567 square foot apartment for 600 dollars a month in Chatham. It's nice enough and affordable, though you would like to have your own place one day. Your parents have both retired and are now traveling around the world. On the other hand, your dream to be a full time journalist for some big newspaper isn't really being pursued with your job as an assistant (aka, coffee getter) at the Herald and side blog about local shops. With that in mind, you get onto the L at your stop as you do every Tuesday morning. As you're scrolling through comments on your blog, you get an email. You have been offered two jobs as a full time journalist by NBC! One of the them is based out in San Francisco and the other in Boston! It's the oppurtunity you've been waiting for. They have already contacted your current employer and you don't need to go into work anymore because NBC wants you working for them by this Friday, but you have to accept and choose which location by the end of the day.
