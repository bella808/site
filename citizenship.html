<h2>What is citizenship?</h2>
<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Welcome to my citizenship web page! Here I discuss what it means to be a citizen and the primary characteristics of good citizenship in 2019.</p>

<h2>Primary Characteristics:</h2>
<h2>Honesty</h2>
<p>Being an honest person is a title we strive for from the time we could comprehend the difference between right and wrong to the day we take an oath or sign on to a new job. It is also a necessary trait to be a good citizen of any country, because in order for a nation to retain an operating justice system and have an efficient mode of spreading information, its citizens must tell the truth.</p>
<h2>Compassion</h2>
<p>Being compassionate is being altruistic--putting any other person's needs before your own. And in the case of being a good citizen being a compassionate person means putting the needs of your fellow citizens before your own for the sake of upholding the commonwealth. Yes there are usually Federally funded or run facilities and/or corporations designed to help the everyday citizen; yet inevitiably they can't help everyone, making it up to us to help one another out.
<h2>Respect</h2>
<p>Basic respect for other human beings let alone fellow citizens is the foundation of any institution, organization and country. Without respect for one another and our rights fundamental systems like a chain of command or competitive business would not work. Enforcing the law would be far more difficult if not impossible without respect from citizens--recognizing authority and importance of laws is what keeps a nation operating.  </p>
<h2>Responsibility</h2>
<p>Responibilty can mean alot of things, but in the case of being a good citizen it could mean, doing your part in your community, or making sure that you and people around you uphold the law. Responsible citizens help uphold safe and efficient communities.</p>
<h2>Courage</h2>
<p>In the United States of America, a founding value is having the freedom and desire to defend what you think is right--this could also br described as being a courageous citizen. It is important to be courageous in order to help defend the rights of you and those around you.
<h2>Faith or Hope</h2>
<p>Having faith or hope in you country is probably the most important characteristic of being a good citizen. Because that faith in your country and its people is the only thing that drives your desire to improve it no matter the current state. Having hope that your country will stick to its values and take care of its people in exchange for loyalty should be the primary reason to obey laws (regardless of the consequences). All of these other characteristics of being a good citizen would be obselete without having faith in your country.</p>
<h2>A Powerful Act of Citizenship:</h2>
<p>It was around 11 pm and raining, my family was driing home from visiting my grandmother out of state. We were at a small intersection when two cars emrged in front of us almost intercepted completly completly tearing off the front of one of them. It only missed us by about a foot or two. Rather than becoming mad at the reckless driver or just ignoring the seen, my father perefctly demonstrated compassion and responsibility by pulling over and asking the young man if he needed help and was okay.</p>
