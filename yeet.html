<h1 style="font-family:impact;">THE END</h1>

<p style="font-family:courier;"> It has been a long week. You go to the grocery store to pick up some food. This person cuts you in line at checkout, so you yeet them across the store, get arrested and lose your job. Now you live alone in a new part of the country without a job.
